MD_Proj
=======



This project, originally from [kdnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/data_mining_course/assignments/final-project.html), was presented to me in a data mining course at the university. This is a version which implementation is performed completely in Python, using the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

You can view the project Jupyter notebook [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ojon/MD_Proj/blob/sklearn-ver/microarrayDiseasesKDnuggets.ipynb).
